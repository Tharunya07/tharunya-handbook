## Guide format

Most guides follow a simple structure:

- **Problem** – what you’re trying to do  
- **When you’d need this** – real scenarios  
- **Prerequisites** – assumptions and setup  
- **Steps** – clear, ordered instructions  
- **Common pitfalls** – things that usually go wrong  
- **Validation** – how to confirm it worked  

Not every guide has every section, but clarity always comes first.
